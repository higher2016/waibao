<b> <font>The principle of the puzzle is very simple. The
		game is played on a 9x13 grid of squares. Each position in the grid
		contains either a stump, a plank or water. The aim of the game is to
		move a player across the water from one side of the grid to the other.
		There are, of coure, rules however:<br>

</b>
<br>
<br>
<font>- The player must start from a designated start position.
	This will always be on a stump.<br>
	 - The player completes a game level when she reaches a designated goal position. This will also
	always be on a stump.<br>
	 - The player can move in any direction,
	but may only walk on stumps and planks.<br>
	 - The player cannot
	swim, or walk on water.<br>
	 - The player may pick up and carry a
	single plank at any point in time. A plank can be picked up if
	the player is standing on a stump directly connected to that plank.<br>
	- A plank may be placed between two stumps in either the horizontal or
	vertical direction, provided it is of the exact size to fit
	between those stumps.<br>
	 - A plank may be one, two or three units
	long.<br> 
	- A plank cannot be laid diagonally.<br> 
	- A plank cannot cross or be laid on or across another plank.<br>
	- The player may rotate a plank to be either horizontal or vertical.<br>
	- The player may not carry more than one plank at a time.<br>
